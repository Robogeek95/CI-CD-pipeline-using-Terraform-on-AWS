        Enjoy a dive into a detailed explanation of the infrastructure, its
        provisioning with Terraform, and the usage of CodePipeline for
        continuous deployment.
      </h3>
      <h3>Infrastructure Overview</h3>

      <p>
        The infrastructure is deployed on AWS and consists of various components
        working together to host and deploy the application.
      </p>

      <h3>Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)</h3>
      <p>
        The Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a logically isolated section of the
        AWS cloud where i can provisioned resources. It provides a private
        network environment for the infrastructure. The VPC is divided into
        public and private subnets, allowing for segregation of resources based
        on their accessibility.
      </p>

      <h3>Load Balancers</h3>
      <p>
        The architecture includes Application Load Balancers (ALBs) that
        distribute incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances or containers.
        ALBs help improve scalability, availability, and security. They support
        SSL/TLS certificates for secure communication and can be integrated with
        AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web
        attacks.
      </p>

      <h3>ECS and EKS</h3>
      <p>
        The Web App and Mobile App components can be deployed using Elastic
        Container Service (ECS) or Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). These
        services provide container orchestration and management, allowing you to
        run and scale containerized applications. ECS and EKS ensure high
        availability, scalability, and ease of deployment.
      </p>

      <h3>Backend App and Database</h3>
      <p>
        The Backend App is hosted in a private subnet within the VPC. It can be
        deployed on EC2 instances or containerized using ECS or EKS, similar to
        the Web App and Mobile App. The database component uses Amazon RDS for
        MySQL v8, a managed database service. RDS provides automated backups,
        scaling, and monitoring, ensuring privacy and security.
      </p>

      <h3>Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</h3>
      <p>
        Terraform is used for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to provision and
        manage the AWS resources. Terraform configuration files (`*.tf`) define
        the desired state of the infrastructure. By running `terraform apply`,
        the configuration is applied, and the resources are provisioned on AWS.
        The modular structure of the Terraform code promotes reusability and
        maintainability.
      </p>

      <h3>Continuous Deployment with CodePipeline</h3>
      <p>
        The CI/CD pipeline is implemented using AWS CodePipeline. CodePipeline
        automates the build, test, and deployment process based on changes in
        the source repository. Here's an overview of how it works:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <bold>Source Stage</bold>: CodePipeline monitors the configured
          repository (Bitbucket or GitHub) for changes. When a new commit is
          detected, it triggers the pipeline.
        </li>
        <li>
          <bold>Build Stage</bold>: CodePipeline uses AWS CodeBuild to build the
          application. CodeBuild reads the build specification file
          (`buildspec.yml`) to define the build steps, environment, and
          artifacts. It can package the application into Docker containers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <bold>Test Stage</bold>: After the build stage, you can include
          additional steps to run tests, ensuring the application meets quality
          and functionality requirements. But i didn't make use of tests in this
          application.
        </li>
        <bold>Deploy Stage</bold
        >: CodePipeline deploys the application to the ECS service. It creates a
        new task definition using the Docker image from the build stage and
        deploys it to the ECS cluster.
        <li>
          <bold>Post-Deployment Actions</bold>: CodePipeline can trigger
          additional actions after the deployment, such as running integration
          tests, sending notifications, or invoking other AWS services.
        </li>
      </ol>

        <h3>Provisioning Infrastructure</h3>

        <p>
          Infrastucture as code has been setup to deploy the entire
          infrastructure using Terraform it is also used to setup CodePipeline.
          Automating the entire process. To provision the infrastructure, you flilow these steps:
        </p>

        <li>Install Terraform on your local machine.</li>

        <li>
          Define the desired infrastructure in Terraform configuration files
          (`*.tf`). This includes resources such as VPC, subnets, security
          groups, ALBs, ECS services, RDS instances, etc. Use modules to promote
          reusability.
        </li>

        <li>
          Set up the necessary variables in the `variables.tf` file or through
          environment variables to customize the infrastructure according to
          your requirements.
        </li>
      </dev>

      <dev>
        <h3>Provision infrastructure</h3>
        <p>
          Next, you perform the following steps to provision the infrastructure
        </p>
        <li>Run `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform configuration.</li>

        <li>
          Run `terraform plan` to preview the changes that Terraform will make
          to the infrastructure based on your configuration.
        </li>

        <li>
          Run `terraform apply` to provision the infrastructure on AWS.
          Terraform will create the defined resources and configure them based
          on the provided specifications.
        </li>

        <li>
          Monitor the Terraform output to track the progress and obtain
          information about the provisioned resources, such as URLs, endpoints,
          and security group IDs.
        </li>
      </dev>

      <dev>
        <h3>Deployment Workflow</h3>

        <p>
          Once the infrastructure is provisioned, the deployment workflow is as
          flilows:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Developers push code changes to the configured repository Github.
          </li>

          <li>CodePipeline detects the changes and triggers the pipeline.</li>

          <li>
            CodePipeline runs the build stage, where CodeBuild builds the
            application and packages it into Docker containers.
          </li>

          <li>
            After successful building, CodePipeline proceeds to the deploy
            stage, where it deploys the application to the ECS service.
          </li>

          <li>
            The ECS service creates a new task definition using the Docker image
            from the build stage and deploys it to the ECS cluster.
          </li>

          <li>
            The ALB directs incoming traffic to the deployed application,
            providing scalability and high availability.
          </li>

          <li>
            Post-deployment actions can be triggered, such as running
            integration tests, sending notifications, or invoking other AWS
            services.
          </li>
        </ol>
